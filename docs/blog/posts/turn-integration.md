# Turn.io Integration Now Available: Your Turn to Play with it

As a question-answering plugin service, Ask A Question requires what we call "chat managers" - platforms that help you build end-user chat flows and integrate with channels like WhatsApp.

To make this integration process easier, we published a [Turn.io](https://turn.io) Playbook. Playbooks are reusable, pre-built chat flows that can be shared with and remixed by other teams in the chat-for-impact community.

<!-- more -->

Find it [here](https://whatsapp.turn.io/app/playbooks/db700074-7db3-4cfb-b73c-87e628ddc1d2). You may need to sign up to see it.

## How do I use it?

Just click on "Activate Journey" and you will see this flow imported in your Journeys.

Next, replace the `<API_KEY>` in the code card with your own API key and you should be good to go. If you are using your own deployment, you will also need to change the URL of the API call.
